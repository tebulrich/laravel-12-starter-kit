## Docker Configuration

### Services

- **PHP**: Runs on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS/HTTP3)
- **MySQL**: Runs on port 3306
- **RabbitMQ**: Runs on ports 5672 (AMQP) and 15672 (Management UI)
- **MailHog**: Runs on ports 1025 (SMTP) and 8025 (Web UI)

### SSL Configuration

The starter kit automatically creates a local SSL certificate and registers it on the host machine:

- **Automatic Certificate Generation**: Uses `mkcert` to create trusted SSL certificates for localhost
- **Host Registration**: Certificates are automatically registered with your system's trust store
- **HTTPS Ready**: Access your application via HTTPS without browser security warnings

### Background Processes

The starter kit comes with pre-configured Supervisor processes that run automatically:

- **Queue Worker**: Processes jobs from the default queue using Laravel's queue system with RabbitMQ
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Runs Laravel's scheduler for cron jobs using the `schedule:work` command
- **Automatic Migrations**: Runs database migrations on container startup
- **Composer Install**: Automatically installs PHP dependencies on container startup
- **Yarn Build Process**: Installs frontend dependencies and builds assets with Tailwind CSS in watch mode

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure as needed
3. Run `docker-compose up -d`
4. Access your application at https://localhost

## Environment Configuration

Key environment variables:

- `APP_PORT`: HTTP port (default: 80)
- `APP_PORT_FRANKENPHP_HTTPS`: HTTPS port (default: 443)
- `RABBITMQ_PORT_AMQP`: RabbitMQ AMQP port (default: 5672)
- `RABBITMQ_PORT_HTTP`: RabbitMQ management UI port (default: 15672)
- `DOCKER_WWWUSER` and `DOCKER_WWWGROUP`: User/group IDs for Docker containers

## Development Workflow

### Frontend Setup

The starter kit comes with a pre-configured frontend setup:

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework with custom configuration
- **Yarn**: Package manager for frontend dependencies
- **Automatic Asset Building**: Assets are automatically built and watched for changes

When the container starts, the following happens automatically:
1. Yarn dependencies are installed (`yarn install`)
2. Assets are built with Tailwind CSS processing
3. The build process continues in watch mode to rebuild on file changes

### Composer Scripts

- `composer dev`: Starts development environment with concurrent processes
- `composer test`: Runs tests

## Security

This starter kit includes security tools:

- **Roave Security Advisories**: Prevents installation of packages with known security issues
- **Spatie Security Advisories Health Check**: Checks for security vulnerabilities
